// Package ancestry implements a data structure for fast ancestry enquiries in binary tree.
/*
Definition

Consider nodes A and B of a rooted tree.
B is called a proper descendant of A if there is a unique simple path from A to B and also A is not B.

Hint

You should read about properties of depth-first search (CLRS 22.3) before implementing this package.
