// Package bitset implements bitset data structure.
/*
Bitset is a fixed-size sequence of bits with an interface for setting and testing individual bits.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_array for more details.

The interface is a subset of std::bitset from C++ (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/bitset).
